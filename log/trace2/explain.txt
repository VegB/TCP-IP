loss rate = 0.5
data packets number = 10
REICEIVER_BUFFER_SIZE = SENDER_BUFFER_SIZE = 10
retransmit time-out = 10
==============================

Well, still haven't implement FAST RETRANSIT yet.
Will retransmit all packets in SenderBuffer when time out.

Receive packets in the following orders:
3 6 7 8 9 3 8 10 3 5 7 8 9 10 3 7 8 10 2(pass 2 3 to tcp) 5 6 9 10 3 4(send 4~10 to tcp).
